# ReadMe 

UltraSimple.user.css is used to replace some of the features of ad blocking software (such as Adblock, ublock origin, etc.)

**Why do we need it?**

1. Many websites recognize ad blocking software and pop up warnings;
2. Once set, it can be reused;
3. Further modification of web page layout.

**What are the restrictions?**

- In some cases (such as Quora), you need to cooperate with ad blocking software.
- Not using the WYSIWYG click-through method, it requires a certain amount of CSS basics.

Why is it hosted on Github? As both the https://userstyles.org and https://openusercss.org are no longer easy to use, the CSS file hosted on Github becomes an option.

## How to use it

Install the plugin Stylus in Chrome and click on the link below:

## Aditional information

- You can convert this CSS to monkey scirpts via the suerstyles website and then use it with tampermonkey (etc.). But I can't guarantee the final result.
- Which websites are currently available? Sorry I can't list all the adaptation sites because all sites are merged into one file. However, you can find a specific site in the original file by using Ctrl+F.
- Is there an update log? You can view it through the Git log.

If you have any questions, we can discuss them through the issue.
